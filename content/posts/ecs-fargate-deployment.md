## Serverless Container Deployment

Learn how we deployed our FastAPI backend using Amazon ECS Fargate for a truly serverless container experience.

### Container Strategy

Our deployment leverages:

- **Docker containers** for consistent environments
- **ECS Fargate** for serverless compute
- **Application Load Balancer** for traffic distribution
- **Auto-scaling** based on demand

### Dockerfile Configuration

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### ECS Task Definition

Key configuration elements:

- **CPU and Memory** allocation
- **Environment variables** from Secrets Manager
- **Health check** endpoints
- **Logging** to CloudWatch

### Benefits

{{< alert "check" >}}
**No Server Management** - Fully managed infrastructure  
**Auto Scaling** - Scales based on demand  
**Cost Effective** - Pay only for what you use  
**High Availability** - Multi-AZ deployment

### Monitoring

- **CloudWatch metrics** for performance tracking
- **Application logs** centralized in CloudWatch
- **Health checks** for container monitoring
- **Custom dashboards** for operational insights
